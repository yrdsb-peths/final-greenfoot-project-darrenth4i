# Summary
This is a recreation of the "wave" gamemode in the game Geometry Dash. To start, run the program and click the play button (top left) to jump in right away! Holding down on mouse makes the wave move up and letting go makes it move down. Dodge obstacles to gain points and unlock new achievements with higher scores!

# Help
Feeling stuck? Don't worry! Clicking the question mark button (bottom left) in game will tell you how to use and understand every feature in the game! 

# Mechanics
Speed portals - going through speed portals will change the speed at which obstacles approach you. They spawn every **13 points** with a **75% chance** to spawn
Gravity portals - going through gravity portas will change the gravity of your wave. Blue portals retain normal gravity, while **yellow portals reverse your inputs** (ex. hold to go down). They spawn eveery **10 points** with a **50% chance** to spawn

# Decoration
Click the gear button (top right) in game to customize the way your wave trail and icon looks! Currently has 3 different coloured trails and icons.

# Note for Teacher
There is a trophy button which shows the achievement section of the game (bottom right) that is based off of your high score. When in the achievement world, holding "o" and "p" will automatically change your high score to 1000 to showcase all achievements being unlocked.

To find the array with animations, go to the Wave class and look under the click() method.
